# slik-app
This is an application designed to receive confocal image microscopy TIFF files, alter and analyze them according to the needs of an epithelial cancer research lab.
A subject of study at Dr. Hipfner's epithelial cell lab is the development of the Drosophila wing disc.
In particular, the lab is investigating the correlation between the prevalence of cancerous growth in the wing disc and the spatial and quantitative qualities of the SLIK kinase over time.
This is a rudimentary image processing application which uses manually adjusted parameters to categorize samples as either cancerous or non-cancerous, and present the slices of interest to the user.
It offers the capability to perform this function on large data sets, so little intervention is required once processing begins.


The software should be updated to utilize machine learning to broaden its applications and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of its use.
